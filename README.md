This code builds two things:

a) The CPDF PDF command line tool for editing PDF files.

b) cpdf as an OCaml library, for which documentation is here:

[https://coherentpdf.com/cpdf/](https://coherentpdf.com/cpdf/)

Prerequisites to build
----------------------

The OCaml compiler

[http://ocaml.org](http://ocaml.org)

The camlpdf library

[http://github.com/johnwhitington/camlpdf](http://www.github.com/johnwhitington/camlpdf)

The ocamlfind library manager

[http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)

If you are using the OPAM package manager:

[http://opam.ocamlpro.com](http://opam.ocamlpro.com)

these can be installed by:

```
opam install camlpdf
```

To build
--------

If downloading from Github, obtain the correct source. This means choosing the
tag for a particular version, such as "v2.8.1". The head of the master branch
is unstable.

1. Type `make` to make the cpdf executable and the library

2. Type `make install` to install the OCaml cpdf library.

The `cpdf` executable should be manually placed somewhere suitable.

Alternatively, the library and command-line binary can be installed by

```
opam install cpdf
```

Documentation
-------------

in this folder once the library has been built.
