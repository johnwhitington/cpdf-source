rotation clockwise (i.e the first quadrant encountered has positive [x] and [y]
values) from East. When the point is [(0, 0)], the result is [0].*)

candidate angles, and see which [a] is numerically closer to. The candidate
points are taken modulo $2\pi$ for this to work. *)

(* Make a quarter-circle from a single bezier curve from [s] to $(s + \pi / 2)
\bmod 2\pi$ with centre [c] and radius [r]. We cheat by making the standard
quarter from [(1, 0)] to [(0, 1)] and rotating using the [Transform] module.

(* Some of the following functions generate what is supposed to be a connected
list of segments. However, since they operate by calculating each segment
seperately, floating point inaccuracies can arise, making the end of one
segment misalign with the start of the next. This function corrects the defect
by copying the end of one segment to the beginning of the next. We only need to
deal with bezier segments for now. *)

are of equal length, the one chosen is undefined. *)
