Jcpdf: Java interface to the cpdf PDF tools
===========================================

The DLLs "libcpdf" and "libjcpdf" are required.

Before using the library, you must make sure your project or build environment
has access to the cpdf DLL, which is not part of the Java .jar. You can add as
am external requirement in your Java IDE. Or, you can install it in a standard
location, such as the Windows system folder.

On Windows, The DLL libcpdf.dll must be renamed to cpdf.dll, for Jcpdf to be
able to find it.

Follow the instructions at the end of Chapter 1 to write your first program. In
addition, the Jcpdf package provides documentation with each function, which
you can view in your IDE.

Usage
-----

Create an instance of the library with, for example:

Jcpdf.jcpdf = new Jcpdf()

You must call startup() to initialise the library prior to calling any other
function.

PDFs are of type Jcpdf.Pdf. Page ranges are of type Jcpdf.Range. Both PDFs and
ranges are not automatically garbage-collected. Use try or the close() method
to dispose of them.

Exceptions are of type Jcpdf.CpdfError and may be raised by any function.
