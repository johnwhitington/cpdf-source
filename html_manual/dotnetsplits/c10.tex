Cpdf.impose(Cpdf.Pdf, Double, Double, Boolean, Boolean, Boolean, Boolean,
Boolean, Double, Double, Double)

Imposes a PDF. There are two modes: imposing x * y, or imposing to fit a page
of size x * y. This is controlled by fit. Columns imposes by columns rather

Margin is the margin around the output, spacing the spacing between imposed
inputs.

two pages on one.

Adds a blank page after every n pages.

Cpdf.padMultiple(Cpdf.Pdf, Int32)
