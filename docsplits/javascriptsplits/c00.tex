// CHAPTER -1: Introduction

/**
Use
---

coherentpdf.js can be used from both node and the browser.

The file `cpdflibtest.js` uses every function in coherentpdf.js. Call `./run`
to run it in node.

For development server-side with node: `coherentpdf.js` (minified version
`coherentpdf.min.js`). Load with `const coherentpdf = require('coherentpdf')`
if installed in npm, or `const coherentpdf = require('./coherentpdf.js')` to
load from current directory.

For development client-side with the browser : `coherentpdf.browser.js`
(minified version for deployment : `coherentpdf.browser.min.js`). Load with
`<script src="coherentpdf.browser.js"></script>` or similar.


Data types
----------

Arguments are numbers, strings, or arrays (of type UInt8Array for data). Page
ranges are represented by arrays of numbers.


Memory Management
-----------------

A PDF p must be explicitly deallocated with deletePdf(p).


Errors
------

Any function may raise an exception, containing a string describing the problem. 


Concurrency
-----------

coherentpdf.js is synchronous and non-re-entrant. In the browser, best used in a worker.
