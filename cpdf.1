.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]cpdf\f[R] is an AGPL\-licensed command line tool for processing PDF
files.
The rest of this man page gives a brief description of each command line
operation and option.
The file cpdfmanual.pdf which you should find installed on your system
or otherwise at https://www.coherentpdf.com/cpdfmanual.pdf gives the
full usage details.
.PP
The sections in this man page follow the chapters of cpdfmanual.pdf.
.SH 1. BASIC USAGE
.TP
\f[B]\-version\f[R]
Print the Cpdf version number
.TP
\f[B]\-help, \(enhelp\f[R]
Gives links to sources of help
.TP
\f[B]\-summary\f[R]
Lists and describes very briefly each command line option
.TP
\f[B]\-o\f[R]
The output filename.
Beware of writing back to the same file.
.TP
\f[B]\-i\f[R]
Cpdf automatically treats any filename ending with .pdf (any case) as an
input PDF.
If your file does not end with .pdf, you can supply the file with
\f[B]\-i\f[R] instead.
.TP
\f[B]\-range\f[R]
Gives the range of pages to be affected by a the operation.
By default, all pages are affected.
The range may be specified without \f[B]\-range\f[R] simply by writing
it directly after the filename it relates to.
Example ranges: \(lq2\(rq \(lq1\-5\(rq \(lq1,2,3\-end\(rq \(lqodd\(rq
\(lqNOT1\-5\(rq.
See cpdfmanual.pdf for a full description.
.TP
\f[B]\-progress\f[R]
Show which operations and on which pages they are operating, as it
happens, on standard error.
.TP
\f[B]\-keep\-version\f[R]
Keep the PDF version of the input document even if features are used
which would otherwise make it increase.
.TP
\f[B]\-fast\f[R]
Presume ISO\-compliant content streams when processing page contents.
This is faster, because it does not involve re\-parsing whole streams to
add content.
.TP
\f[B]\-idir \f[R]
Add a whole directory of PDFs as inputs.
.TP
\f[B]\-idir\-only\-pdfs\f[R]
Restrict \f[B]\-idir\f[R] to only files ending in .pdf (any case).
.TP
\f[B]\-recrypt\f[R]
Re\-encrypt output files using the same encryption parameters (if any)
as the input file.
.TP
\f[B]\-decrypt\-force\f[R]
Allow the output file to be written decrypted even if permissions would
otherwise prevent it.
.TP
\f[B]\-stdout\f[R]
Write the output file to standard output instead of to a file with
\f[B]\-o\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-stdin\f[R]
Read the input PDF from standard input instead of from a named file.
.TP
\f[B]\-stdin\-user \f[R]
Supply the user password for the PDF which is from standard input.
.TP
\f[B]\-stdin\-owner \f[R]
Supply the owner password the the PDF which is from standard input.

Set the creator of the output file.
.TP
\f[B]\-change\-id\f[R]
Change the PDF\(cqs ID field when writing the output file.

Linearize the PDF when writing.
Requires a linearizer to be supplied with \f[B]\-cpdflin\f[R].

\f[B]\-cpdflin \f[R]
Give the path of an external linearizer.
For example, Qpdf.
.TP
\f[B]\-keep\-l\f[R]
Keep the linearization status (either linearized or not) of the input
file upon output.
Requires a linearizer to be supplied with \f[B]\-cpdflin\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-no\-preserve\-objstm\f[R]
Do not preseve existing object streams when writing the output file.
Note that \f[B]\-create\-objstm\f[R] and
\f[B]\-no\-preserve\-objstm\f[R] may be used together \- the effect is
then to redo all object streams.
.TP
\f[B]\-create\-objstm\f[R]
Create new object streams when writing the output file.
Note that \f[B]\-create\-objstm\f[R] and
\f[B]\-no\-preserve\-objstm\f[R] may be used together \- the effect is
then to redo all object streams.
.TP
\f[B]\-args \f[R]
Read command line arguments from the given file by direct textual
substitution into the command line, prior to any other processing.
.TP

Its path may be supplied with \f[B]\-gs\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-gs\-malformed\f[R]
This option is used to allow Cpdf to call out the \f[B]gs\f[R] command
to pre\-process badly malformed files as a last resort.
See section 1.13 of cpdfmanual.pdf for details.
.TP
\f[B]\-gs\-malformed\-force\f[R]
This option is used to allow Cpdf to call out to the \f[B]gs\f[R]
command to pre\-process badly malformed files as a last resort.

.SH 2. MERGING AND SPLITTING
.SS Merging
\f[B]cpdf \-merge in1.pdf\f[R] [<range>] \f[B]in2.pdf\f[R] [<range>]
[<more names/ranges>] [\-collate] [\-collate\-n <n>]
[\-retain\-numbering] [\-merge\-add\-bookmarks
[\-merge\-add\-bookmarks\-use\-titles]] [\-remove\-duplicate\-fonts]
[\-process\-struct\-trees] [\-subformat <subformat>] \f[B]\-o
out.pdf\f[R]
.PP
The \f[B]\-merge\f[R] operation allows the merging of several files into
one.
Ranges can be used to select only a subset of pages from each input file
in the output.
The output file consists of the concatenation of all the input pages in
the order specified on the command line.
Actually, the \f[B]\-merge\f[R] can be omitted, since this is the
default operation of Cpdf.
.TP
\f[B]\-collate\f[R]
Instead of ordinary operation, take the first page from the first
document, then the first from the second and so on.
Then the second page from the first document and on until all pages are
exhausted.
.TP
\f[B]\-collate\-n\f[R]
Like collate, but in chunks of more than one page.
.TP
\f[B]\-retain\-numbering\f[R]
Keep the page numbering of each input file intact, rather than
renumbering the pages in the output document beginning at 1.
.TP
\f[B]\-merge\-add\-bookmarks [\-merge\-add\-bookmarks\-use\-titles]\f[R]
Add a top\-level bookmark for each file, using the filename.
\f[B]\-merge\-add\-bookmarks\-use\-titles\f[R], when used in conjunction
with \f[B]\-merge\-add\-bookmarks\f[R] uses the titles from document
metadata instead.
.TP
\f[B]\-remove\-duplicate\-fonts\f[R]
Ensures that fonts used in more than one input appear only once in the
output.
.TP
\f[B]\-process\-struct\-trees\f[R]
Merge input structure trees in the output.
.TP
\f[B]\-subformat\f[R]
If \f[B]\-subformat\f[R] \(lqPDF/UA\-2\(rq is given, together with
\f[B]\-process\-struct\-trees\f[R] Cpdf will add a top\-level Document
structure tree element.
.SS Portfolios
A PDF portfolio is a special kind of PDF with contains other documents
(PDF and otherwise) within it.
Support is mostly limited to Adobe products at time of writing.
.PP
cpdf \-portfolio in.pdf \-pf <filename> [\-pfd ] [\-pfr <relationship>]
[\-pf \&...]
\-o out.pdf
.PP
The input in.pdf here is the main file.
You can build a blank one with \f[B]\-create\-pdf\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-pf\f[R]
The filename for each file to include in the portfolio.
.TP
\f[B]\-pfd\f[R]
The description for the file (must appear after \f[B]\-pf\f[R]).
.TP
\f[B]\-pfr\f[R]
The so\-called relationship for the file (must appear after
\f[B]\-pf\f[R]).
.SS Splitting
We can split an input PDF into its constituent pages, and output one PDF
for each page.
.PP
cpdf \-split in.pdf [\-chunk <chunksize>] [\-process\-struct\-trees]
[\-utf8] \-o <format>
.PP
The output format has many options (see cpdfmanual.pdf for details).
But the simplest is just to number the outputs in sequence.
For example cpdf \-split in.pdf \-o out%%%.pdf will produce out001.pdf,
out002.pdf and so on.
.TP
\f[B]\-chunk\f[R]
Choose a chunk size other than 1.
.TP
\f[B]\-process\-struct\-trees\f[R]
Split the input document\(cqs structure tree into the output documents.
.TP
\f[B]\-utf8\f[R]
This option may be required in the case of some output formats.
See cpdfmanual.pdf for details.
.SS Splitting on bookmarks
We can split on bookmark boundaries, at a given level, instead of
splitting on each page:
.PP
cpdf \-split\-bookmarks <level> in.pdf [\-process\-struct\-trees]
[\-utf8] \-o <format>
.TP
\f[B]\-process\-struct\-trees\f[R]
Split the input document\(cqs structure tree into the output documents.
.TP
\f[B]\-utf8\f[R]
This option may be required in the case of some output formats.
See cpdfmanual.pdf for details.
.SS Splitting to a given size
We can split the file, if possible, to a maximum filesize for each
output PDF:
.PP
cpdf \-split\-max <file size> in.pdf [\-process\-struct\-trees] [\-utf8]
\-o <format>
.TP
\f[B]\-process\-struct\-trees\f[R]
Split the input document\(cqs structure tree into the output documents.
.TP
\f[B]\-utf8\f[R]
This option may be required in the case of some output formats.
See cpdfmanual.pdf for details.
.SS Interleaved splitting
We can use \f[B]\-spray\f[R] to write the split pages to more than one
named output file.
When Cpdf runs out of output files, it adds the next page to the first
output file, and so on until all input pages are exhausted.
.PP
cpdf \-spray in.pdf [\-process\-struct\-trees] [\-utf8] \-o a.pdf [\-o
b.pdf [\-o \&...]]
.TP
\f[B]\-process\-struct\-trees\f[R]
Split the input document\(cqs structure tree into the output documents.
.TP
\f[B]\-utf8\f[R]
This option may be required in the case of some output formats.

Whereas the \-twoup operation does the same, but scales the new sides
down so that the media box is unchanged.
