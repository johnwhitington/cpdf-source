CHAPTER 2. Merging and Splitting

Cpdf.mergeSimple(List{Cpdf.Pdf})

Given a list of PDFs, 
merges the files into a new one, which is returned.

Cpdf.merge(List{Cpdf.Pdf}, Boolean, Boolean)

Merges the
PDFs. If retain_numbering is true page labels are not rewritten. If
remove_duplicate_fonts is true, duplicate fonts are merged. This is useful
when the source documents for merging originate from the same source.

Cpdf.mergeSame(List{Cpdf.Pdf}, Boolean, Boolean, List{List{Int32}})

The same as merge, except that it has an additional
argument - a list of page ranges. This is used to select the pages to
pick from each PDF. This avoids duplication of information when multiple
discrete parts of a source PDF are included.

Cpdf.selectPages(Cpdf.Pdf, List{Int32})

Returns a new document which just those pages
in the page range.
