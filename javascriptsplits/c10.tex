// CHAPTER 9. Multipage facilities

/** Imposes a PDF. There are two modes: imposing x * y, or imposing to fit a
page of size x * y. This is controlled by fit. Columns imposes by columns
rather than rows. rtl is right-to-left, btt bottom-to-top. Center is unused
for now. Margin is the margin around the output, spacing the spacing between
imposed inputs. */

two pages on one. */
