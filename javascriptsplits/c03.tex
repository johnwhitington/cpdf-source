// CHAPTER 2. Merging and Splitting

/** Given a list of PDFs, merges the files into a new one, which is returned. */
function mergeSimple(pdfs)

/** Merges the PDFs. If retain_numbering is true page labels are not
rewritten. If remove_duplicate_fonts is true, duplicate fonts are merged.
This is useful when the source documents for merging originate from the same
source. */
function merge(pdfs, retain_numbering, remove_duplicate_fonts)

/** The same as merge, except that it has an additional argument - a list of
page ranges. This is used to select the pages to pick from each PDF. This
avoids duplication of information when multiple discrete parts of a source PDF
are included. */
function mergeSame(pdfs, retain_numbering, remove_duplicate_fonts, ranges)

/** Returns a new document with just those pages in the page range. */
